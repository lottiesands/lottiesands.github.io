I was once asked by a researcher where my motivation lay when it came to working in ai, and whether I would have been interested in ai twenty or thirty years ago. He was prompting me to think about whether it is worth spending my life working on one thing or many. Lots of people seem to want to make a career out of an interest, only for some force of reality to derail that ambition and cause them to be distracted by the details of life.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Although, it probably isn’t that clean-cut. A clear vision might pass, but the underlying curiosity remains. Our curiosity transforms and takes on a new form, familiar, but different enough for us to miss the connection. This is why it is rare for someone to be thrown entirely off course with deeply harboured regrets.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But the points where change is hardest are worth zooming in on. Times are painful when we are moving away from something that attracts our curiosity. This is most obvious when we feel we are losing something that bought us a sense of achievement.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In contrast, time moves fast when we are orbiting around our deepest interests. These activities are always autotelic.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In this way, the greatest career one can ask for is one where each job is ambitious and important. By allowing ourselves to be ambitious with each job, we make few compromises, and, given enough time, can really make progress by working on deeply satisfying things for a long time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>By satisfying this curiosity, we not only overcome life’s limitations, but set the foundation for work that is truly revolutionary. Some academics are thrilled by the idea of divergence, or ‘open-endedness’. Others, by the solidity of a proof. This deeply held curiosity becomes a powerful heuristic for the best in the field to make decisions that are nothing short of optimal. It is the reason why they might solve a problem at almost inhuman speed. Or why they look somewhere nobody else thought to.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For instance, Feynman’s theme appears to be - compression - exploring many things and transforming them into a form that is elegantly communicable with enthusiasm - a great theme for a teacher to have. Courage is more authentic when it comes with a genuine excitement for the work itself. Altman’s seems to be - scaling - persistently seeking exponential returns governed only ‘by <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1760473881884987606?lang=en-GB" class="leverage">god</a>’. This is well captured in a favourite question of his, “what’s the one thing, done today, that would help you grow fastest?”</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>LeCun describes the field of ai as a study of learning representations, each model brings distinct benefits in the guise of these unique representations. This view hints at a deeper, profound principle: a quest for efficiency and essence in how we understand, model, and interact with the world. It is about achieving the greatest impact without the use of force, but instead with an elegant, reduced version of reality that equals those of the human condition and extends it by untold orders of magnitude.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Finding those junctures where a small nudge can lead to exponential change is something that, upon reflection, seems to be consistently the strongest connection I can draw between important memories. It is also a meta-theme, hence my compulsion to share.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Once this idea is planted, human curiosity demands that we seek and find our own.</p>
